# covidDashboard
COVID ETL and dashboard repo for Geospatial Cloud Computing @ UPenn, Fall 2021

## Data Sources
We choose four aspects of COVID-19 data, confirmed cases, hospitalization, death and vaccination mainly from OpenDataPhilly. Some data from CDC (Search & Browse Page 1 of 111 | Data | Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (cdc.gov)) might also be considered. The data form that we will utilized in our project includes csv, geojson, shp and API.  We will also use the aggregated number by different groups of sex, race and age categories provided by all these datasets. Both real-time and historical data by ZIP is needed in our project. All the datasets are open-accessed to us.
